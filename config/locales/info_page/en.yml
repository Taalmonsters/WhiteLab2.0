<p></p><p>
OpenSoNaR+ is a webinterface by means of which you can access two Dutch reference corpora, viz. The STEVIN Nederlandstalig Referentiecorpus (SoNaR) for written Dutch and the Spoken Dutch Corpus (Corpus Gesproken Nederlands, CGN), either independently of each other or in combination. For users less experienced in the use of corpus exploitation software OpenSoNaR+ offers a simple interface which makes it possible to search the corpora using words, lemmata and part-of-speech tags. More experienced and expert users may use the Corpus Query Language (CQL). Metadata filters can be used to restrict the search to specific subsets of the data. Results can be viewed in their contexts while for the spoken data from the CGN there is also the possibility of making them audible. Results can also be exported.

<h2>Documentation</h2>
</p><p>
A manual about the SoNaR corpus can be found <a href="http://ticclops.uvt.nl/SoNaR_end-user_documentation_v.1.0.4.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p><p>
Documentation for the CGN is available <a href="http://tst-centrale.org/images/stories/producten/documentatie/cgn_website/doc_English/start.htm" target="_blank">online</a>. The documentation includes various protocols that were used in the construction of the Spoken Dutch Corpus (e.g. for orthographic transcription, POS tagging and lemmatisation, phonetic transcription). See under Version 2.0/Protocols.
